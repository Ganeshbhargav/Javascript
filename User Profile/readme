# 👤 User Profile Page

✅ **Status:** Solved  
🟢 **Difficulty:** Easy  

## 📄 Project Description

This project dynamically generates a user profile card using **vanilla JavaScript**. It demonstrates key concepts such as **DOM manipulation**, **object data rendering**, and **element creation**. The page is fully built via JavaScript, without hardcoding any profile content in the HTML.

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Creating and appending elements with JavaScript
- Accessing object properties to populate the UI
- Using `textContent` and `src` for updating elements
- Applying clean styling with CSS and Google Fonts

## 📌 Features

- 👤 Name displayed as a heading
- 🖼️ Profile image rendered from a dynamic source
- 📅 Age shown in a paragraph
- 🧱 All content created with JavaScript (no static HTML elements)
- 🎨 Styled with the **Roboto** font for a modern look

## 📂 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)

## 🔧 How It Works

A simple JavaScript object provides the data:

```javascript
const profileDetails = {
  name: "John Doe",
  imgSrc: "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
  age: "28 years old"
};
