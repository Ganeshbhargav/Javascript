# 👤 User Profile Page

✅ **Status:** Solved  
🟢 **Difficulty:** Easy  

## 📄 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to dynamically generate a User Profile Page using **vanilla JavaScript**. It leverages core JavaScript concepts such as **DOM manipulation**, **element creation**, and **data rendering** from an object. The profile page is created entirely through JavaScript with minimal initial HTML.

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- Dynamically creating and appending HTML elements using JavaScript
- Accessing and rendering object data into the DOM
- Using properties like `.textContent` and `.src` to update DOM elements
- Applying basic CSS for layout and styling
- Using web fonts (Roboto) for a modern UI

## 📌 Features

- ✅ User's name displayed as a heading
- ✅ Profile image rendered dynamically from the `imgSrc` value
- ✅ Age shown in a paragraph
- ✅ All elements are created and appended via JavaScript
- ✅ Clean, responsive design using Roboto font

## 📂 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)

## 🔧 How It Works

The project uses a predefined JavaScript object:

```javascript
const profileDetails = {
  name: "John Doe",
  imgSrc: "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
  age: "28 years old"
};
