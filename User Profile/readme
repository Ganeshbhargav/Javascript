 üë§ User Profile Pag
Status: ‚úÖ Solved
Difficulty: üü¢ Easy

üìÑ Project Description

This project demonstrates the creation of a **dynamic User Profile Page** using core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, element creation, and data rendering from an object. The goal is to use the provided `profileDetails` object and dynamically generate a user profile card inside a predefined HTML container.

üõ†Ô∏è What I Learned

* Dynamically creating and appending HTML elements using JavaScript
* Accessing and rendering object data into the DOM
* Using attributes like `textContent` and `src` to update HTML elements
* Applying CSS for basic layout and font styling

üìå Features

* User's name displayed as a heading
* Profile image dynamically rendered using the `imgSrc` value
* Age displayed in a paragraph
* Fully generated using JavaScript, with no hardcoded HTML elements (other than the container)
* Styled with the Roboto font for a clean look

üìÇ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**

## üîß How It Works

The project uses a predefined object `profileDetails`:

```javascript
const profileDetails = {
  name: "John Doe",
  imgSrc: "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
  age: "28 years old"
};
```

From this, JavaScript dynamically creates:

* A heading element for the name
* An image element for the profile picture
* A paragraph element for the age

All these are appended as children to the container with the ID `profileContainer`.

## üìù Notes

* Prefilled code must remain untouched.
* The layout and styles aim to match the provided design reference.
* This project reinforces dynamic DOM handling, useful for real-world applications like user dashboards or content feeds.
